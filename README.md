# Code Refactor Starter Code

The purpose of this project was to refactor Horiseon's existing site to make it more accessible & optimized for search engines. 


## Refactor Description

Application's CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

Simplified `header` by replacing the an unnecessary `div` with a `nav` bar.

Condensed the `div` selectors in class `content` to one class `card` in CSS.

Condensed the `div` selectors for the benefits section. Replaced individual classes with one parent class (benefits-lbc) for the 3 benefit options (lbc - lead generation, brande awareness, cost management).

Assigned 'id' attributes to each respective section in the .content `div`. All application links are now functional.

Added accessible alternative attributes to the icon & `img` elements.

Reordered the heading attributes so they fall in sequential order

Renamed the title element to a more concise, descriptive title.
